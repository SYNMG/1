Hello! I hold a PhD in finance, specialising in corporate finance and corporate governance. 🎓 Additionally, I have obtained degrees in MFin, BBUS, and BEc. 📚 My expertise lies in conducting empirical research and leveraging analytical skills to derive insights in the realm of finance. 📊

With over 6 years of teaching experience at Massey University, I have honed a strong teaching background. I showcase a proven track record in delivering a diverse range of finance and economics courses, both on-campus and through distance learning, to a varied student cohort. 📚 My teaching prowess has been recognised through commendable feedback in the Massey MOST survey, alongside the attainment of Associate Fellowship status at the Higher Education Academy (AFHEA). 🏆
